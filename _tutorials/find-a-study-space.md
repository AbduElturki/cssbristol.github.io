The university has a couple of pages for finding study spaces. [Here's the main one](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/study-spaces/).

## New: find a free desk

Library staff count the number of people in each library hourly. In the exam periods this year, the university is trialling ['Find a study desk'](https://www.bris.ac.uk/where-is-my/find/computer/table), which is based on this data.

Hot tip: there's a JSON API! Here's the [building information](https://www.bris.ac.uk/where-is-my/find/api/v1/building?extended), and here are the [study space stats](https://www.bris.ac.uk/where-is-my/find/api/v1/study-space-stats).

There's also a page for [finding a free computer](https://www.bris.ac.uk/where-is-my/find/computer/table).

## Where else can I work?

Some places that aren't officially documented. Found an obscure place to work? [Open an issue and we'll add it to this page](https://github.com/cssbristol/cssbristol.github.io/issues)

### MVB

If you've done or are doing Software Product Engineering, you should have access to MVB 2.09 (just beyond 2.11). If you need a second monitor, this is the place to go.

### Queen's Building

If you're really pushed, rumour has it that there is some soft seating in the east wing of Queen's Building. Good luck finding it.

More useful is the [student workshop](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/engineering/facilities/student-workshop/) - equipment includes a laser cutter; 3D printers; a lathe and [one of these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmvKlnhMjUw). You'll need to be trained on some of the equipment first but if you're planning to take part in BEEES [Robot Wars](http://www.beees.co.uk/events/robotwars/) you're probably going to spend a lot of time in here.

### Humanities - Woodland Road

There are a few common rooms accessible to everyone between 3 and 19 Woodland Road. These houses are joined by a corridor at the back, so you can enter at one end and walk along the whole thing.
