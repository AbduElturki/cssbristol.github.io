IT Services hosts a huge range of systems, many of which are well kept secrets! We'll have a look at some of them in this article.

## Snowy

Every CS student has an account on the departmental server, snowy. [Read the snowy tutorial](/tutorials/ssh-into-snowy/).

## VPN

The university VPN allows you to access university resources (e.g. journals, firewalled internal systems) from anywhere.

[Setup instructions](https://www.bris.ac.uk/it-services/advice/homeusers/uobonly/uobvpn/)

## Remote Desktop

You can also remote into a standard university desktop from anywhere. Some commercial software that you cannot install on personal machines is available on remote desktop. IT Services record the status of each piece of software in [Topdesk](https://servicedesk.bristol.ac.uk/tas/public/xfg/softwarecataloguesearch).

## Network Filestore - MyFiles

Every student has a 'MyFiles' filestore, which you can mount on your own device while connected through the university network (i.e. eduroam, VPN, Remote Desktop).

## Free Software

While studying, you have access to various university-licensed software. This includes:

* Microsoft Office
* SPSS
* Maple
* Matlab

## Laptop Clinic

If you need help with a computer, phone or software, you can get help from the [Student Laptop and Mobile Clinic](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/it-services/advice/homeusers/help/laptopclinic/), which runs in [Senate House](http://www.bris.ac.uk/maps/google/?latlng=51.45902083,-2.603437900000017&t=0&h=1) at 2pm to 5pm, Monday to Friday.

The clinic is staffed largely by current computer science students. Towards the end of the academic year, IT Services advertises for new students to staff the clinic - so keep an eye out!

## Wikis

The university hosts an Atlassian Confluence install, which you can use to [create your own wikis](https://wikis.bris.ac.uk/dashboard.action).

## Online Tools

[Password tools](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/it-services/advice/iam/usernamesandpasswords.html) - check that your password is working correctly. Sometimes UoB and Google passwords become desynced - you can fix it here.
