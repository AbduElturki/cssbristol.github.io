# Hi there, we're CSS Bristol!

CSS is the official Computer Science Society at the University of Bristol, run by students, for students. We represent all the students within our department, organise social events and industry talks, run a mentor scheme, advertise job openings exclusive to our students, and much more!

This website is our society's hub: feel free to read our [user-submitted tutorials](/tutorials) and [student blogs](/blog), see what we're up to on our social media presences, and get updates on society news and events.
