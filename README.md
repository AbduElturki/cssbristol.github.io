# Computer Science Society - University of Bristol

## Overview

This repository contains the code for the University of Bristol Computer Science Society website, [cssbristol.co.uk](http://www.cssbristol.co.uk/).

The site is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a static site generator. If you want to get Jekyll running locally, GitHub provides [some instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll/).

When a commit is made to `master`, GitHub will automatically rebuild the site and the updated version will start being served to users.

If you have comments or questions, there are lots of ways to get in touch:

* Email [webmaster@cssbristol.co.uk](mailto:webmaster@cssbristol.co.uk)
* Create an issue
* Find a committee member in person
