# Welcome!

Hello! We are the University of Bristol Computer Science Society.

Congratulations on getting into a great university and department (which just happens to be full of great people!)

You'll be *rather* busy over the next few weeks, so we've collected together some information which you might find useful.

## Freshers' Week 2016-17

We've got a number of exciting events lined up for Freshers' Week (or, as the uni would rather have us call it, Welcome Week). Details will be posted here and on the calendar as they become available, but here's what we're planning:

* Trip to Allstars for some pool (and beer)
* Film evening
* An exciting(-ish) stand at the Welcome Fair
* A night out. Yes, computer scientists *can* party ðŸŽ‰ðŸ’¾
