Just like every year we are organising the parenting scheme for incoming CS students, including students on the CS joint honors courses. You are all invited to participate in this as 'CS parents'; you will either choose a CS friend to be your co-parent or be randomly paired with another existing student, as well as 5-6 incoming students to form a CS family. The purpose of this is to give incoming students someone who can help them settle in, socialise and give them a first point of contact in this new environment. It is also an opportunity for older students to meet more people from their course and participate in social events, like a family meal which will be reimbursed by us.
