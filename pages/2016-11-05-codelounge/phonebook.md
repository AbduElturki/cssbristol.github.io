# Phonebook

Below is a link to the zip file of the phonebook project. It contains the skeleton code we've provided for you as well as a guide on how to get started. Don't be afraid to ask for help or to work in teams to get things accomplished. If you manage to get this done and fancy doing some more don't be afraid to do some research or ask a helper for some tips.
