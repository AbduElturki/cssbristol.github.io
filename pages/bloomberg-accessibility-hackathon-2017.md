## Prizes

There will be prizes (TBC!)

## Theme

This year's theme: **build something that makes the world a more accessible place**!

We're deliberately keeping this as broad as possible, because we want to see what you come up with!

Maybe you'll build:

* Screen readers for augmented reality
* An alternative to mouse and keyboard
* Eye-tracking interfaces
* Hearing aids that only relay the most important information
* A design for privacy settings that children can understand
* Drones that pick stuff up for people

The more ambitious, the better ðŸ˜‰

## Resources

We're keen to help teams with access to any equipment or resources they might need for their project. [Contact us](mailto:webmaster@cssbristol.co.uk) if you know you're going to need something, and we'll see what we can do.

For example, you might want:

* A Raspberry Pi, Arduino, mbed, ESP32 or other development board
* Powerful compute resources, like an Amazon EC2 GPU instance
* Sensors or camera modules
