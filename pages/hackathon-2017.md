## Theme

This year's theme: **build something that might help protect or improve the environment**!

We're deliberately keeping this as broad as possible, because we want to see what you come up with!

Maybe you'll write a piece of software with super-low energy requirements. What about a system for monitoring your vegetable patch? Or a robot that turns off unused appliances? You could write a vision algorithm that detects damage to forests or ice shelves. Perhaps you'll even write a cool visualisation that uses Bristol's Open Data platform.
