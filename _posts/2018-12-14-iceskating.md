No better way to get into the Christmas spirit than with some ice skating! 🎅⛸⛸⛸🎄🎁
We are heading down to the ice rink this Friday for an ice skating session. And then having some drinks at The Apple afterwards, perhaps some mulled wine to warm you up?

First round's on us!

Be sure to get the 8:00pm - 8:45pm Disco Boots session on Friday the 14th.

Hope to see you there! :)
