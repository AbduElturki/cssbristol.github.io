We're excited to host Nick Hills from Bristol based company True Clarity who will be giving a talk on creating Alexa skills and more!

Pizza involved.

/ Nick Hills: Alexa, spin the wheel?

It’s that time in the morning, the office tea round. But who ‘wins’ the honour of making the round? We could patiently wait for someone to buckle and give in, or we could ask one of our digital sidekicks to spin the wheel of tea fortune. Cloud computing at its full potential? Possibly not, but let us explore the technologies, skills and challenges involved in building your own Alexa skill.

/ About Nick

Nick is a principal developer and Sitecore MVP working at True Clarity. At the moment most days are spent ensuring the AWS infrastructure powering easyJet’s website keeps people flying. His background is mainly web and .net focused however rather enjoys getting stuck in with all kinds of different toys and technologies.
