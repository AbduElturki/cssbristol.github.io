# CSSxCOGS LAN

## Saturday 27th Oct. | 10am-10pm
## Sunday 28th Oct. | 10am-10pm

First COGS LAN of the year, joint with the Computer Science Society in MVB 1.11 for 24 hours.

You will need to bring your own PC/Laptop and monitor, and we also welcome people bringing consoles. We will also be providing a few consoles like at our Console Socials, so you can come even without a PC!
