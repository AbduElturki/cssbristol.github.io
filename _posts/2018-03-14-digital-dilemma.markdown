Join us on Wednesday 14 March for the #DigitalDilemma event #2!

An academic panel including speakers from SPAIS (Sociology, Politics and Int'l Studies), Law, and Computer Science Schools will be discussing how technology is shaping our societies, both positively and negatively – including through the digitisation of elections, predictive analysis & use of data by law enforcement, creation of "cyberweapons", and many more.

Is technology a curse or a blessing for democratic (and not-so) societies? What safety measures – political, legal and technical – do we need in place to ensure the setbacks of such a fast-pace development are minimised?

These and other questions will be posed to our speakers:
• Dr Miranda Mowbray (CSS);
• Ms Clare Stevens (SPAIS);
• Mr Kit Fotheringham (Law);
• Dr David Bernhard (CSS).

See you there – we're anticipating a very diverse range of perspectives covered!
