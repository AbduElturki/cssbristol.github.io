**15th March 13:00-14:00 MVB 1.11**

We are pleased to announce our first ever Units Choice Event, requested by you!

Until now there has been no convenient way to hear real feedback from other students, making unit choice decisions a huge gamble.

This event aims to fix this and give everyone the opportunity to get real feedback. It also gives students the chance to be properly heard!

If you want to hear feedback about specific unit(s), let us know using this form:
[https://goo.gl/forms/tvzppaqyISJZw3kU2](https://goo.gl/forms/tvzppaqyISJZw3kU2)

Also, If you want to share your opinion and experience (good/neutral/bad) with other students about particular unit(s) then tell us about it using the same form as above.

Free food will be provided!
