It's our first event of this term! You'll be writing gaming AI bots to compete against a selection of Oxford and Glasgow's finest societies:

* Oxford CodeSoc
* Oxford AI Society
* Oxford AI Games Club
* Glasgow GUTechSoc

You'll be representing your university, so do your best comrade.

[AIGaming](https://www.aigaming.com/) is a platform that lets you win Bitcoin by writing bots to win games like Battleships or Blackjack. We'd recommend getting some practice in - but the challenge on the night will be a mystery!
