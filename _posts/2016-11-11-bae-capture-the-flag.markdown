## About the challenge

The Operational Cyber Group from BAE Systems Applied Intelligence are running a Capture the Flag event; a day of cyber security challenges and games. Anybody who is currently enrolled in Computer Science at Bristol can sign up and play. There are prizes for the winning team and goodies for anyone taking part!

If you’re interested in a career in cyber security or just want a day of technical fun, please do sign up and take part! This is a team-based event for teams of 2 to 6 players. If you don’t have a team yet then don’t worry – register and come along anyway as teams will also be created on the day. The challenges will involve breaking into vulnerable websites, cracking ciphers, forensic analysis, reverse engineering and much more. No previous experience of these kinds of challenge is necessary; they are designed for computer science students who like taking things apart and seeing how they work.

Event runs all day from 9.30 to 16:30. Lunch (Dominos!) will be provided, so get on down!
