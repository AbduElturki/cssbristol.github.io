## Rules (tl;dr-edition):

* Teams of up to 6 people
    * Teams made of 50% or more committee **cannot** win
* Use whatever engine you like
    * Judging will take the complexity into account, however

(full-length rules will be posted soon™️)

## Top tips:
Coming soon!

## Q&A:

* *I don't have a team!*
    * That's OK! We'll team you up with some other people :)
* *I don't feel skilled enough to participate!*
    * You probably are! A lot of time spent in hackathons is spent on **learning** - first years have won in the past
* *I don't have a good game idea!*
    * Have a look at some other games for inspiration; copy an existing game; or use [this idea generator](http://orteil.dashnet.org/gamegen)
* *Will there be free pizza?*
    * You know it.
