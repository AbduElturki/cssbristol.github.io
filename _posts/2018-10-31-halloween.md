Hey all! You can't celebrate Halloween without "enjoying" a horror!

So we'll be showing a horror film this Wednesday in Chemisty: Lecture Theater 3 (for educational purposes)
🎥🎬🧛🧛‍

There will be lots of popcorn and various snacks!
🍿🍿🥨🍧🍰🍬🍭

PS. You can always bring work with you and hide behind your screen if you're too scared.
