Mobile cameras are everywhere; wearable cameras are coming! Current computer vision technology can summarise your day, figure out your routine, even teach you how to perform a new task and remind you if you forgot to switch off the hob after cooking. What are the potentials and limitations of such technology? How mature is it, and when does it fail? This talk will not discuss privacy concerns. It offers a bright outlook into our tech-enhanced future.

[Dima Damen](https://www.cs.bris.ac.uk/~damen/) (Senior Lecturer, Department of Computer Science)
