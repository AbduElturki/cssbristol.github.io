After Monday's successful workshop Jay has offered to continue his tutorials and teach us a bit about AR! Come along, learn iOS and eat pizza!

If you would like to code along you'll need a Mac with Xcode version 9.0 or newer. A link to code and slides from Monday's session will be posted soon so watch this space.

Jay may potentially follow up with a third workshop on Machine Learning, most probably on another day.
