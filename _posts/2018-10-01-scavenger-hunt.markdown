Get ready for a Family Scavenger Hunt!

Nothing brings people closer together than slightly odd stories.
So, we have organised a scavenger hunt for you this Thursday.
Get into your families or other groups of friends and see if you can get enough points to win top prize!

The actual hunt starts at 9pm, so make sure you come early (8:30pm) to prepare.

SNEEK PEEK OF SOME QUESTIONS:
- Get a complete (non CSS) stranger to stand on their chair (10 points)
- Stack 5 pint glasses (5 points)
- Get your whole team to drink out of the same drink simultaneously (5 points)

* **Location:** The White Harte, Bristol
* **Date:** October 4, 8:30pm
