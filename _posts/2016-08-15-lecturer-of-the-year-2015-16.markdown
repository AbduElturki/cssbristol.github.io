It is that time of year again where we look back on the year that has just passed. What went well, what could have gone better, what moments we cherished but most importantly - Who was the lecturer that got you that 2:1 in the unit that everyone failed!

Voting is now open for the 2015/16 Lecturer of the Year award! You can now vote for your favourite lecturer here: https://goo.gl/forms/HkuxXZoCzQAuPYZp2

You can also add a little note telling us why you think your choice of lecturer deserves the award (Although, you don't have to - You are more than welcome to just cast your vote and leave it at that)
Results shall be announced at this year's returning students reception on October 5th, where the winner shall receive a prize!

(If you can't find a lecturer on the list, please let me know on here or at president@cssbristol.co.uk and I shall rectify this. Although, do note: Benjamin Sach is not eligible for this year's award as he won last year)

Also, to enforce the 1 vote per person limit (Because, clearly everyone is out to rig these things, you know?), you must be signed into your myBristol gmail account to vote (But, don't worry, we don't retain which email voted for which lecturer - We're not that evil ;) )

Good luck to the lecturers and may the best teacher win!
