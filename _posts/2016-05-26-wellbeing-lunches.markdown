Interested in [wellbeing](/wellbeing) in the department? Bring your lunch to 3.22MVB on a Friday.

We'll be chatting informally about anything and everything to do with wellbeing and mental health. Thanks go to [Tim Kovacs](http://www.cs.bris.ac.uk/~kovacs/), who is organising this. If you have any ideas on how to make the faculty a healthier and happier place he would love to hear them.

All students and staff from the faculty (and other faculties) are welcome.

The lunches will be at the same time and place for the next three Fridays - the last being June 11.
