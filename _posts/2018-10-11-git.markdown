**11th October 1.00-1:50pm MVB 1.11**

Welcome to our first talk of the year!
Our very own David Bernhard will be giving an introductory talk on how to use **Git**, aimed at first-years (but everyone is welcome)

There will be free pizza üçï as always (& vegan/gf alternatives ü•ô - see poll in discussion).

Not able to go to the talk? Relevant notes are available [here](www.ole.bris.ac.uk/bbcswebdav/users/csxdb/pub/git/)
