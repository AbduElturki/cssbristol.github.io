We're lucky to have two engineers from Oracle's Bristol office coming to the department next Tuesday to talk about software deployment and delivery.

In this tech talk you will learn about technologies and techniques that are used to rapidly develop, test and deploy complex software at huge scale.

We'll be taking a whistle-stop tour through:

* Test Driven Development
* Continuous integration
* Continuous delivery
* Containerisation (Docker)
* Logging, monitoring and metrics
* Advanced debugging

We hope to see you there!
