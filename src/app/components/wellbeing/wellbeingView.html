# Rational behind this page
###

To provide as much information on the support available to students as possible in the most clear and concise way.

Key Considerations:
- Provide information on the situations each service is equipped to deal with.
- Contact information where applicable: website, email, web, phone, address.
- Many students do not speak English as their first language. Keep the sentence construction and vocabulary clear and easy to understand.
- Aim for inclusivity of information, rather than only the most common problems
- Some of this content might make people feel uncomfortable to see. This might be because they find the topic awkward, have been personally affected by it, or are skeptical about the severity / worth / importance of the problem. Any and all steps should be taken to make people feel comfortable with the content, and explain why it is necessary.
- While the page aims to have as much information as possible, make sure it is all framed in a way such that its relevance is immediately clear to computer science students.

    <div class="section-content clear">
      <p>
        This page is for all Computer Science students (whether at undergraduate, master student or post graduate level) at the University of Bristol. It also serves for students on joint honours courses like Computer Science and Electronics, or Computer Science and Maths. It aims to hold all of the information we need on where to seek support during our studies. In the past, it has been difficult to know exactly where to go if we have a problem that is affecting our studies, but is not strictly academic in nature. This page aims to solve that, and put all of the resources in one place.

    <div class="section-title">What sort of problems does this include?</div>
    <div class="section-content clear">

      <p>
        In short, anything that is having a negative impact on your ability to study, or otherwise do the things you want to do. This might include, but is definitely not limited to:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Family problems like a bereavement, or separation of parents.
        </li>
        <li>
          Problems with flatmates or friends, whether in real life or online in discussion forums like Facebook, Twitter, Yik-Yak and Snapchat. It also covers problems working with other people in group projects.
        </li>
        <li>
          Struggling to cope with deadlines. This might be balancing you effort between multiple assignments, or simply finding the stress of it all is stopping you being as capable as you feel you should be. We all get stressed, it is part of the course. A certain amount of stress can be motivational, even healthy. The moment it begins to affect your day to day happiness or will and ability to function as a person, then it is a good idea to seek help.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you had a pre-existing problem when you arrived at university and want to know what support is available. This might be a physical or mental illness, special requirements for exams, or anything you have needed help for in the past. It need not be something <i>official</i>, university can be a good opportunity to seek help for a problem you've not looked to solve before.
        </li>
        <li>
          Any sort of trouble with sexism, homophobia, racism, transphobia, ableism or discrimination of any kind. Whether you experience this yourself, or as something you have witnessed as a 3rd party.
        </li>
      </ul>
        
      <p>
        It is worth giving special mention to two subjects in particular. We do not hold them to be more or less important than others mentioned, but time has shown that they have been encountered a disproportionate amount both at Bristol, and in the wider Computer Science community.
      </p>
        
      <p class="section-subtitle">Stress &amp; Mental Health</p>
      <p>
        Studying Computer Science is stressful. Multiple deadlines, exams and group project all add up and take their toll. Many people are able to cope with this stress, but for some people it starts to affect their health outside of University and their ability to function properly. For some, it can lead to bouts of depression, and other mental illness. This has been a very taboo topic in the past, with a lot of misunderstanding and grief as a result. It is important that we create an environment within the computer science community at Bristol where people feel able to ask for help without worrying about stigma and how their peers will judge them. Similarly, if someone does open up to you, it is important that you are comfortable in knowing how to respond! There is a lot of advice on line on talking about mental health, and how to seek help. This page won't seek to replicate that, but the services listed below have lots of information on it.
      </p>
        
      <p class="section-subtitle">Nastiness In Online Discussion Spaces</p>
      <p>
        We all know the internet has both wonderful corners and darker ones. Above all, we know the importance of respecting each other online, and not forgetting that there is a real human on the other end of a comment thread. Occasionally this does get forgotten, and nastiness ensues. If you ever feel uncomfortable in an online space or in person, then the department, students union and university have guidelines on how to deal with it. As a union affiliated society, CSS is bound by their safe space policy. Such policies are often drastically misunderstood and end up being ridiculed online. Bristol SU's safe space policy can be read <a href="https://www.bristolsu.org.uk/pageassets/activities/societies/roomandequipmentbookings/Safe-Space-Policy-motion.pdf" target="_blank">here</a> so you know exactly what it does and does not say. There are also some <a href="https://www.bristolsu.org.uk/pageassets/democracy/events/policy/SafeSpaceBestPracticeGuide-Edited.pdf" target="_blank">guidelines</a> available for how to interpret the safe space policy in a sensible way. Any problems you have yourself, or witness as a 3rd party, can be raised with your personal tutor or the students union.
      </p>

      <p>
        Again, none of this is supposed to be a definitive list. At the end of the day, if you feel that your ability to study is being negatively affected by something, then the best thing you can do is seek help as soon as possible, and not bottle it up and hope it passes!

      <p class="section-subtitle">Personal Tutors</p>
      <p>
        For most things, your personal tutor should be your first point of contact. They can usually point you in the right direction when it comes to seeking further help, and are best placed to help with problems that are academic in nature like friction  with team mates or other coursework. It is their job to fight your corner in all matters between yourself and the department.
      </p>
      <p>
        You should have been told who your personal tutor is, and have met them! If for any reason you don't know who they are, then you can find out by looking at your profile on <a href="https://wwwa.fen.bris.ac.uk/coms/index.jsp" target="_blank">SAFE</a>.

        The Vulnerable Students' Support Service coordinates support for our most vulnerable students who are, for whatever reason, having difficulties functioning or continuing their studies for non-academic reasons. They work closely with staff in academic schools and students are supported by the most appropriate service(s) from within Student Services and/or from the NHS. Wherever possible they prefer to provide pre-emptive support but are experienced in managing crises.
      </p>
      <p>
        Examples of support include cases of students with undiagnosed or unsupported mental ill health including first incidents of psychosis, the consequences of addiction, those who are seemingly missing, victims of domestic violence, managing family estrangements, and many more.
